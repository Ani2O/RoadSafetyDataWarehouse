# RoadSafetyDataWarehouse

A data warehouse design and implementation project for analyzing road fatality data using PostgreSQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Description
This project creates a scalable data warehouse to consolidate crash statistics, demographic information, and environmental factors to support road safety analysis.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy mlxtend`
2. Set up PostgreSQL and load SQL scripts from the `sql` folder.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebook for ETL and analysis.
- Execute SQL scripts  in PostgreSQL.


## Files
- sql :Database schema and loading scripts.
- python: ETL and association rule mining code.
- Schema diagram.

## Notes
- Raw data files (e.g., CSV) should be placed in the `bitre_fatalities_dec2024` and 'bitre_fatal_crashes_dec2024'folder but are not included due to size/privacy concerns.
